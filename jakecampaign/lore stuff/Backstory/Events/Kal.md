On the night [[Kal - Kalyre Fleistroro]] 's house burned down, he had dreamed of disaster. His mom had tried to save him, and nearly did, yet Kal had left his treasured [[Music Box]] back in the house. Upon going to get it, a burning beam crushed his mother and killed her, and also crushed his legs. Kal does not remember how he survived.

***From Ethan;*** 

Kal was maybe 12 in human years, after he pissed off the noble, he burned down Kal’s house in the dead of night. The last thing he heard before being saved by druids was his mother, and the sound of the music box. When he was saved by the Druids they fused whatever parts of his lower legs they could salvage with his boots (which now are [[Kal's Boots]] of elven kind) when he was healthy enough to move again he decided to leave his town, the people were happy to take him in but the memories of the fire were too much. He packed up whatever he had left (bag of holding + carving tools and a bow) and set off into the deep forests. He spent 5 years living in the forest before making his way to civilization, in that time he learned basic hunting and gathering, made friends with animals, as well as getting pretty good with a bow (as much as my rolling would say otherwise lol) he started doing jobs for townsfolk around the age of 17, he did mostly farm work and labor jobs in exchange for food and shelter, it wasn’t until he was 19 that he started regularly traveling between towns. That’s when the he started doing guild work and ended up in the raver where we all met multiple years later.

***Post Death;** ****

Saved by [[The Creator]]. Told Kal that he was their champion, and that he was to protect their children that lived on the mortal plane. Blessed Kal, made him Fae Touched, doing weird gentle parenting thing. Said Kal was not grateful enough of their gifts and was VERY mad

Kasuth gave him a quest to go find a priest in Phandalin (Iorno Albreich aka Glass Staff). Was told that he would get his love back if he did so. Reported burning on wrist. ([[Themis and his weird quests]])

The Night Themis Left:

**Themis in front of the arch ember mage (character that jake sent me to draw), themis knows it as the mouthpiece of the flame. Stirring white hot lava with his hand, cultists all around chanting, his second in command and themis’s mentor, the spreader of the flame. Stilla (THEMIS’S BITCH??????)  in the corner, he looks worried. Themis realizes he cant do this and knows he is going to fail. Stilla heals themis a smidge. Ember mage very slightly tightens grip, tilts head to the side, and throws themis to the wall. Ember mage radiating malice. Themis is titled the Bearer of Flame. Stilla saying that they couldnt have possibly caught them

**That Night. Noises outside and there is screaming. Themis rushes to go see what the cause is. Stilla being dragged away by the hair, arch ember mage watching. Stilla calling out for themis. Ember mage walks up to themis, leans down and says “make your choice.” themis goes to try and grab Stilla, guards get him. He betrayed themis, gave him up, and that is the night that themis runs from the cult.**

Ms [[Adastra Solion]]came from a LONG line of powerful casters with incredibly traditional values and married for convenience to one [[Steven Ahnicaster]], wanting a daughter to marry off for political reasons as to gain more power within high-society. …Enter Nicholas.

  

After Nicholas was born, Adastra locked in on her wishes for a daughter, raising Meera socially as a woman. He was her show-pony at noble galas– her darling daughter that she let wear PANTS! Everso progressive of her! Meera himself was unaware of the goings on, merely flouncing around parties with a polite smile on his face whilst his mother talked about her dearest Nichole, falling ever sicker by the day. At age ten, Meera was deemed too powerful, too noticeable to still exist as Nichole to the rest of the world, and as such, was locked in his room– alone in the wing of his house, with nothing but a window that faced the great ocean blue to keep him company. Nicholas was ill. This, he knew. He was sickly and frail, and he was but a half-elf without magic. An unfortunate pull from his fathers human genes. What was kept secret from him was that fateful night, the book his mother read to him as he drifted off to sleep, when she made him repeat everything mentioned– just to test if he remembered. How his mother loved her tests. How he wished they kept up even as his health declined.


Ship destroyed by [[The Beast]]. Called the S.S. Pibb

Post Destruction;

**
Woke up in a coastal village, was taken in by a local hostel. Put him on a bed and said “wow this guy looks rough” didnt do much after that. Oh Fuck my family is dead. First month post ship was finding out the game rules & new things

Been 8 months since the ship crashed

Stayed in waterdeep the longest. Had to leave and come back, came back to waterdeep the most. Picked up odd jobs (hustling, illegal gambling/betting)

-has underworld connections
-probably been arrested (caught n roughed up at Least once)
-in the slums
-could find what was valuable and what was not. Vendor ripping people off, could clock it and rally people to riot

1 week = 10 days (sword coast)
